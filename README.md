Optimization
===

This package contains some functions to facilitate my study process of constrained optimization problems.

Functions for

- Plotting level curves
- Plotting possibilities frontier
- Finding feasible set

Also, the objective is to learn some new programming skills, such as

- use of specific functions, such as: `optimx()`, `optim()`, `optimize()`, `constrOptim()`, `contour()`, `uniroot()`, `deriv()`

- techniques such as: [plotting functions](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/3365_9573f6d661b444499365fe1841ee65d3.html) , using [closures](), [functionals](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functionals.html#functionals-math) and [non-standard evaluation](https://rpubs.com/hadley/lazyeval)(mostly formulas)

- packages, such as: purrr, lazyeval, optimx, and others in the CRAN Task View of Optimization and Mathematical Programming

- resources: such as [this](http://virgo.unive.it/paolop/papers/GMP.pdf) and [this](http://horicky.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/optimization-in-r.html)
